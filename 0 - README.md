Title: Winning Space Race with Data Science

Summary: In this project, I was assumed as a data scientist that works for a startup that aspires to compete with SpaceX. In completing this project, I've followed and applied the data science methodology, which entails data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and results delivery to fictitious stakeholders. The main objective of this data science project was to predict the landing outcome of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket's first stage. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches with a cost of 62 million dollars on its website, which is a staggering 103 million dollars below the cost claimed by its competitors (165 million dollars). According to SpaceX, this substantial cost reduction comes from the reusability of the rocket's first stage. Therefore, if we can determine whether or not the rocket's first stage will safely return to Earth, we can forecast the cost of a launch. In this project, I've applied data science using Python programming to predict the returnability of the rocket's first stage to herald the launch cost. With the findings and models I obtained and built in this project, the competing startup may make better-informed bids against SpaceX for future rocket launches.

Clarification: This project was submitted to fulfil the requirement for my IBM Data Science Professional Certificate as well as the IBM Applied Data Science Specialization.
